<h2>
Bakery Algorithm
</h2>
</center>

<h2>1. Overview</h2>

The Bakery algorithm is one of the simplest known solutions to
the mutual exclusion problem for the general case of N process.
The basic idea is that each non-thinking process has a variable
that indicates the position of that process in a hypthetical queue
of all the non-thinking processes.
Each process in this queue scans the variables of the other processes,
and enters the critical section only upon determining that it is at
the head of the queue.
<p>
But the resulting algorithm is still not easy to understand.
So in this note we first look at a simplified version of
the bakery algorithm,
based a coarser grain of atomicity than is allowed by
the mutual exclusion problem.
Then we look at the original version.

</p><h2>2. Simplified Bakery Algorithm</h2>

The processes are numbered  0, 1, ..., N-1.
Each process i has an integer variable
num[i], initially 0,
that is readable by all processes but writeable by process i only.
<p>
When process i is thinking, num[i] equals zero.
When process i becomes hungry, it sets num[i] to a value
higher than the num of every other process;
this operation is assumed to be atomic in this simplified algorithm.
Then process i scans the other processes in order.
For each process j,
process i waits until num[j] is either zero or greater than num[i].
After going past every process, process i enters the critical section.
Upon leaving the critical section, process i zeroes num[i].
</p><p>
The entry and exit codes for process i are:

</p><pre> entry(i) {   
    i.1: num[i] := max( num[0], num[1], ... , num[N-1] ) + 1 ;
          // i.1 is atomic
         for p := 0 to N-1 do  {      // p is local to process i
    i.2:   while num[p] != 0 and num[p] &lt; num[i] do no-op ;
         }
 }

 exit(i) {
    i.3: num[i] := 0 ;
 }</pre>

<p>
<b>Notation:</b>&nbsp;
For brevity, we introduce the following notation:
</p><ul><li>
For processes i and j,
``i passes j'' means that i executes the while loop i.2
with i.p=j and the condition false (i.e., num[j]=0 or num[j]&gt;num[i]).

</li><li>
For a hungry processe i and any process j,
``i passed j'' means that in its current execution of the for loop,
process i has already executed the while loop i.2
with i.p=j and the condition false (i.e., num[j]=0 or num[j]&gt;num[i]).
</li></ul>
<h3>Proof of Safety</h3>
<p>
Suppose process i starts eating at
t<sub>0</sub>.
Consider any other process j (need to show that j is not eating at
t<sub>0</sub>).
At some time
t<sub>1</sub> (&lt; t<sub>0</sub>),
i passed j.
So num[j]=0 or num[j]&gt;num[i] holds at
t<sub>1</sub>.
</p><p>
<b>Case 1:</b>&nbsp;
Suppose num[j]=0 holds at  t<sub>1</sub> .
Then j is thinking at  t<sub>1</sub> , i.e., control is at j.1.
If j becomes hungry at some time
t<sub>2</sub>,
it sets num[j] to a value higher than num[i].
So j cannot pass i during the interval
(t<sub>2</sub>, t<sub>1</sub>).
</p><p>
<b>Case 2:</b>&nbsp;
Suppose num[j] is not equal to 0
and num[j]&gt;num[i] holds at  t<sub>1</sub> .
Then it suffices to show that j has not yet passed i.
Let j have chosen its num at time
t<sub>2</sub> .
Because num[j] is higher than num[i],
 t<sub>2</sub>  must be in the interval
(t<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;t<sub>0</sub>).
Thus at  t<sub>2</sub> , j has not passed i.
Thus j has not passed i at  t<sub>0</sub> .
</p><p>
<b>end of safety proof</b>
</p><p>
</p><h3>Proof of Progress</h3>
<p>
Suppose i becomes hungry at time  t<sub>1</sub> .
We need to show that it eventually eats.
Because the max operation is atomic,
no two processes with non-zero nums can have their nums equal.
Thus all processes with non-zero nums are totally ordered by num.
</p><p>
We show that queue is FIFO.
A process joins the queue when its num becomes non-zero.
But because this can only happen via the max operation,
the process would join at the tail of the queue.
The process at the head of the queue has the smallest non-zero num.
So it never gets stuck in the while loop test for any process.
So it eventually eats.
</p><p>
<b>end of progress proof</b>
</p><p>
</p><h2>2. Original Bakery Algorithm</h2>
<p>
We now consider the original bakery algorithm,
that is, without assuming the max operation to be atomic.
We will show that it works assuming only read-write atomicity of
boolean variables and integer variables
ranging over 0..N.
Because the max operation is no longer atomic,
two processes may get non-zero nums with the same value.
</p><p>
The processes share two arrays:
</p><pre>    boolean flag choosing[i] initially false ;
    integer num[i] initially 0</pre>
<p>
Variables choosing[i] and num[i] are writeable by process i only
and readable by all other processes.
num[i] is 0 when process i is thinking.
(num[i],i), when num[i] is not equal to 0,
is the timestamp of process i's request.
choosing[i] is true while num[i] is being set to non-zero value.
</p><p>
When process i becomes hungry, it sets num[i] to one higher than
all the nums of the other processes.
Then for each process j,
process i first busy waits until process j is not in the middle of
choosing a num,
then it busy waits until process j's num is either zero or greater
(in timestamp order) than num[i].
After going past every process, process i enters the critical section.
</p><p>
Upon leaving the critical section, process i zeroes num[i].
</p><p>
The entry and exit codes for process i are:

</p><pre> entry(i) {   
    i.1: choosing[i] := TRUE ;
    i.2: num[i] := max( num[0], num[1], ... , num[N-1] ) + 1 ;
    i.3: choosing[i] := FALSE ;
         for p := 0 to N-1 do  {       // p is local to process i
    i.4:   while choosing[p] do skip ;
    i.5:   while num[p] != 0 and (num[p],p)&lt;(num[i],i) do skip ;
         }
 }

 exit(i) {
    i.6: num[i] := 0 ;
 }</pre>

<p>
<b>Notation:</b>&nbsp;
For brevity, we introduce the following notation:
</p><ul><li>
For processes i and j,
``i passes j'' means that i executes the while loop i.5
with i.p=j and the condition false (i.e., num[j]=0
or (num[j],j)&gt;(num[i],i)).</li><li>
For a hungry processe i and any process j,
``i passed j'' means that in its current execution of the for loop,
process i has already executed the while loop i.5
with i.p=j and the condition false (i.e., num[j]=0 
or (num[j],j)&gt;(num[i],i)).</li><li>
Given a statement labeled S,
``at S'' means that control is at the start of S,
``in S'' means that control is inside S,
``after S'' means that control is immediately after S.
Note that if S is atomic, then ``in S'' never holds.

</p></li></ul>
<h3>Proof of Safety</h3>
<p>
Suppose process i starts eating at time t<sub>0</sub>.
Consider any other process j.
We need to show that process j is not eating at t<sub>0</sub>.
</p><p>
Prior to entering the critical section,
process i found 
choosing[j] to be false at some time
t<sub>1</sub>(&lt;t<sub>0</sub>),
and passed j at some time
t<sub>2</sub>
where
t<sub>1</sub>&lt;t<sub>2</sub>&lt;t<sub>0</sub>.
At t<sub>1</sub>, process j is either
at j.1 or in j.4..6.
</p><p>
<b>Case 1:</b>&nbsp;
Suppose at j.1 holds at t<sub>1</sub>.
Then num[j] = 0 at t<sub>1</sub>.
If num[j] changes during (t<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;t<sub>0</sub>),
it would become higher than (num[i],i) and
process j would not get past process i.
</p><p>
<b>Case 2:</b>&nbsp;
Suppose process j is in j.4..6 at t<sub>1</sub>.
Then we have two cases:
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<b>Case 2.1:</b>&nbsp;
Suppose (num[j],j) &lt; (num[i],i) holds at t<sub>1</sub>.
Then process i would not have gotten past process j
until num[j] became zero, i.e., process j completes eating,
at which point this case reduces to case 1.

<p>
<b>Case 2.2:</b>&nbsp;
Suppose (num[j],j)&gt;(num[i],i) holds at t<sub>1</sub>.
We want to show that at time t<sub>1</sub>
process j has not gotten past process i.
(This implies that process j does not get past process i
before time t<sub>0</sub>.)
</p><p>
Let t<sub>3</sub> be the time when process j last executed j.3
prior to t<sub>1</sub>.
Let t<sub>4</sub> be the time when process i last executed i.3
prior to t<sub>1</sub>.
t<sub>4</sub>&lt;t<sub>1</sub> holds obviously.
t<sub>3</sub>&lt;t<sub>1</sub> holds because process j is in j.4..6 at
t<sub>1</sub>.

There is no order between t<sub>3</sub> and t<sub>4</sub>,
but t<sub>3</sub> is after process i last executed i.1
(otherwise num[j] would be less than num[i]).
Thus at t<sub>3</sub>,
process i is either choosing a num or has its num.
Thus process j gets past j.4 with j.p=i only after
t<sub>4</sub>,
Thus at max(t<sub>3</sub>,t<sub>4</sub>),
which is before t<sub>1</sub>,
process j has not gotten past process i.
Thus process j would not get past process i
before  t<sub>1</sub>.
</p></ul>
<p>
In any case, process process j would not be eating.
</p><p>
Note that a proof by contradiction would probably be a bit shorter.
</p><p>
<b>end of safety proof</b>
</p><p>
</p><h3>Proof of Progress</h3>
<p>
Suppose process i becomes hungry at time  t<sub>1</sub> ,
i.e. executes i.1.
We need to show that it eventually eats.
The only places where process i can get stuck indefinitely are
the while loops i.4 and i.5.
So it suffices to show that this does not happen.
</p><p>
Rather than arguing at the level of the statements,
it is instructive to take a more abstract view.
With respect to a hungry process i,
we can divide the processes into four groups:
</p><ul><li>
a process j is in group 1 if in j.3..6
(i.e. num[j] is nonzero).</li><li>
a process j is in group 2 if in j.2 and
started executing j.2 before process i finished executing i.2
(i.e. num[j] is zero but it may be assigned a value less than or equal
to num[i]).</li><li>
a process j is in group 3 if either it is in j.1 or
it is in j.2 and it
started executing j.2 after process i finished executing i.2
(i.e. num[j] is zero and if it is changed it will be assigned
a value greater than num[i]).
<p>
</p></li></ul>
<p>
A process j in group 1 with (num[i],i)&lt;(num[j],j) holding
will not eat before process i eats
(because j will not get past process i).
Thus the group 1 processes are queued in their timestamp order.
</p><p>
A process j in group 2 eventually joins group 1
(because the execution of j.2 cannot be blocked by other processes).
It can join at any place in the ``timestamp queue'' of group 1,
i.e., it does not have to join at the end.
</p><p>
A process j in group 3 may eventually join group 1,
but it will only do so behind process i.
</p><p>
If process j is at the head of group 1's queue,
then eventually either j will eat or
another process (from group 2) will get ahead of it.
</p><p>
Let F<sub>1</sub> be the number of processes in group 1 ahead of process i.
Let F<sub>2</sub> be the number of processes in group 2.
Then  F<sub>1</sub>+F<sub>2</sub> keeps decreasing,
and so process i eventually eats.
</p><p>
A better metric is the lexicographically ordered two-tuple
(F<sub>2</sub>,&nbsp;F<sub>1</sub>).
If F<sub>2</sub> is non-zero, then eventually either
F<sub>2</sub> decreases and F<sub>1</sub> increases
or F<sub>1</sub> decreases.
In either case the metric decreases, and it cannot go below (0,0).
