This file describes the details filesystem implemented:
	- Max files is 64
	- Max size of a file = disk_space / 64
	- The filesystem uses a fat table
	- All filesystem structures are dynamically sized (with 
	  exception to number of files/file descriptors) when 
          running formatfs.c based on the max disk space
	- The bitmap is stored at address 0
	- The file descriptors are stored at the end of the bitmap
	- The fat table is stored at the end of the file descriptors
	- The max length of a file name is 52 characters
