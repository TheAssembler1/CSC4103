<h3>
Peterson's Algorithm</h3>
<b>Common data objects:</b>
<pre><tt>int turn = 0;<br>bool flag[2] = {false};</tt></pre>
<b>Code:</b>
<pre><tt>flag[i] = true;<br>turn = j;<br>while (flag[j] &amp;&amp; turn == j)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ;<br>&nbsp;//&nbsp; CS<br>flag[i] = false;</tt></pre>
<b>Idea:</b>
<ul>
<li>
<tt>flag[i]</tt> indicates position of P<sub>i</sub> with respect to mutual
exclusion</li>

<li>
<tt>turn</tt> resolves simultaneity conflicts</li>

<li>
some process sets <tt>turn</tt> last (before entering the <tt>while</tt>
test)</li>
</ul>

<h3>
Proof:</h3>
<b><u>Mutual Exclusion</u></b>
<br>Proof by contradiction: assume both P<sub>0</sub> and P<sub>1</sub>
are in their CS
<br>- then flag[0] = flag[1] = true
<br>-&nbsp;the test for entry cannot have been true for both processes at
the same time (because turn favors one);
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; therefore one process must have entered its CS first (without
loss of generality, say P<sub>0</sub>)
<br>- but this means that P<sub>1</sub> could not have found turn = 1 and
therefore could not have entered its CS (i.e. contradiction)
<p><b><u>Blocking</u></b>
<br>Consider P<sub>0</sub> blocked at the while loop:
</p><p><b>Progress</b>
</p><p><i>Case I: (Stuck)</i>
<br>P<sub>1</sub> is not interested in entering its CS
<br>- then flag[1] = false
<br>- hence the while loop is false for P<sub>0</sub> and it can go
</p><p><i>Case II: (Deadlock)</i>
<br>P<sub>1</sub> is also blocked at the while loop
<br>- impossible, because turn = 0 or 1
<br>- hence the while loop is false for some process and it can go
</p><p><b>Bounded-Waiting</b>
</p><p><i>Case III: (Starvation)</i>
<br>P<sub>1</sub> is executing its CS repeatedly
<br>- upon exiting its CS, P<sub>1</sub> sets flag[1] = false
<br>- hence the while loop is false for P<sub>0</sub> and it can go (sufficient?)
</p><p>However, P<sub>1</sub> may attempt to re-enter its CS before P<sub>0</sub>
has a chance to run.
<br>- but to re-enter, P<sub>1</sub> sets flag[1] to true and sets turn
to 0
<br>- hence the while loop is true for P<sub>1</sub> and it waits
<br>- the while loop is now false for P<sub>0</sub> and it can go
